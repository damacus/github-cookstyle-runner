<project_purpose>
  <architecture>

    - The project automates running Cookstyle (a RuboCop-based linter for Chef) on GitHub repositories and can create pull requests for fixes.
    - The core logic is in the RepositoryProcessor class, which handles repo updates, Cookstyle runs, and PR creation.
  </architecture>
</project_purpose>

<refactoring_and_code_quality>

  - Significant refactoring has been done to reduce cyclomatic complexity, improve readability, and minimize parameter count (using output objects/hashes).
  - Helper methods were extracted for each logical step, making the code more modular and testable.
  - Early returns and guard clauses are favored for clarity.
</refactoring_and_code_quality>

<testing_and_tdd>

  - The project values Test Driven Development (TDD).
  - RSpec is used for unit and class testing, and integration tests are written for security features.
</testing_and_tdd>

<linting_and_style>

  - RuboCop is the canonical style guide.
  - Code is formatted and auto-corrected to match RuboCopâ€™s defaults.
  - RuboCop is (or will be) run in development, pre-commit, and CI workflows.
</linting_and_style>

<automation_and_ci>

  - GitHub Actions are used to build and test all code.
  - Plans exist to integrate RuboCop and other quality checks into CI.
</automation_and_ci>

<documentation_and_planning>

  - All code and changes are documented in Markdown.
  - There is a detailed, step-by-step plan for migrating to GitHub App authentication, with code samples and security best practices.
  - The OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) is used for planning and execution.

<future_improvements>
  <testing_and_coverage>
    - Increase test coverage: Ensure all refactored code is covered by unit and integration tests.
    - Add mutation testing: Use tools like mutant to ensure tests are robust.
  </testing_and_coverage>
  <automation>
    - Pre-commit hooks: Enforce RuboCop and RSpec checks before commits.
    - Automated dependency updates: Use Dependabot or similar tools.
  </automation>
  <security>
    - Secrets management: Use a secrets manager for GitHub App keys and sensitive config.
    - Security audits: Periodically run static analysis and dependency vulnerability scans.
  </security>
  <performance_and_scalability>
    - Optimize subprocess handling: If running many repos in parallel, consider job queues or background processing.
    - Monitor resource usage: Add logging/metrics for performance bottlenecks.
  </performance_and_scalability>
  <developer_experience>
    - Onboarding docs: Expand documentation for new contributors.
    - Sample configs: Provide example .rubocop.yml, config.yml, and GitHub Actions workflows.
  </developer_experience>
  <user_features>
    - Multi-repo/organization support: As planned, support multiple installations with the GitHub App.
    - Webhooks: Consider using GitHub webhooks for event-driven processing.
  </user_features>
  <continuous_improvement>
    - Regular code reviews: Encourage peer review for all PRs.
    - Retrospectives: After major changes, review what went well and what can be improved.
  </continuous_improvement>
